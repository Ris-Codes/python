>## Getting Started

## Reserved Words

-[TOC](#table-of-content)

These are words that **means exactly what python expects to mean**. That is, you are not allowed to use these words other than for the purpose that Python wants.

```Python
 False   class   return   is       finally
 None    if      for      lambda   continue
 True    def     from     while    nonlocal
 and     del     global   not      with
 as      elif    try      or       yield
 assert  else    import   pass
 break   except  in       raise
```

## Sentences or Lines

-[TOC](#table-of-content)

Python reads a line by analysing **Variables, Operator, Constant and Reserved Words** in the line or in the sentences.

## Python Scripts

-[TOC](#table-of-content)

  - Interactive Python is good experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long.
  - Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file and tell Python to run the commands in the file.
  - In a sense, we are **giving Python a script**.
  - As a convection, we add **.py** as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.

  ## Program Steps or Program Flow

  -[TOC](#table-of-content)

   - A program is a **Sequence** of steps to be done in order. When a program is running, it flows form one step to next. We set up **paths** for the program to follow.

   - Some steps are **Conditional** - they may be skipped.

   ![ConditionalSteps](images/ConditionalSteps.png)

   - Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be **Repeated**. Loops (Repeated steps) have **iteration variables** that change each time through a loop.

   - Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed in several places throughout the program.
